add timeout functionality to backend for error checking
write tests: 
    basic polling with 0 retries, delay, 3 retries, default exponential smoothing, user custom expoential smoothing function
        after pending time -> success
        after pending time -> errror
            client timeout: job duration > client request timeout limit
            server timeout: job duration > server request timeout limit 
            server error: server returns 500 

clean code: utility functions, naming conventions, comments/formating for readability 
more features to add?
